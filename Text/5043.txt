Go ahead.

You know I'm not like you, Sonetto. You've trained your whole life to battle with arcanum. I ... took a different path ...

You are a careful reader.

I'll help you out. Don't worry.

Fifty minutes left. Come on, let's move.

And this is ...?

Enemy ahead. Now!

Found them.

Indeed. We have 45 minutes.

I'll do my best to help before the "Storm" arrives.

Now everyone, get ready to break through!

Regulus, you're doing this too.

Sonetto, your assistance please.

The breach is behind us. The alley towards King's Road!

We need to take them down first. Sonetto, your assistance, please!

Careful! There's another gang of rioters! They're blocking the way ahead!

*cough* ... Is anyone hurt?

... also in Kingly Court.

It's nothing. I have my own mission ...

I see. Let's go, Sonetto.

Have you found out where Regulus usually spends her time? Or anyone who knows her?

...

You haven't seen the "Storm" yet, have you?

What are you going to do after Regulus's registration? The "Storm" is about to come.

She must've been in a rush, leaving all that behind.

Do you like the world outside, Sonetto?

Thank you very much for your assistance.

I'm her friend. She left something.

Are you talking about Regulus of the APPLe?

"Bang!"

Shocked for half a second, Regulus pushes Vertin away with great strength.

Now, push me.

Meet me at the bookstore on Oxford Street.

I need your help. So until you can give it to me, I'll help you out.

It's a Misty Bubble Ball. You know how to use it, right?

Vertin squats next to Regulus and blocks Sonetto's eyesight.

Her face has gone pale ... Let me check her out.

*coughs* ... Protect your eyes ...

*coughs* ... Protect your eyes ...

Sonetto ... are you really going to continue the mission?

The "Storm" will arrive shortly.

If you don't go back now, it'll be too late.

Exactly. Isn't this the bookstore?

Misty Bubble Balls have an easily traceable scent. Sonetto will be here any minute.

Relax. I'm not going to take you to the Foundation. I simply ask that you go somewhere safe with me.

Regulus, I need you to <b>brave the "Storm" </b>with me.

Shh! She's here.

I'm sorry ...

In ten minutes.

The collage of Richard Hamilton falls from the sky, splashing rain all over her.

But she just nods in a hasty manner, her eyes seemingly frozen.

You can see it too, which proves you're the one I'm looking for.

She draws back in haste until falling down in a puddle behind her.

Enough! Stop running!

The "Storm" is here.

At the last moment, Vertin finally manages to open the suitcase and push Regulus inside.

Look at the world through your own eyes!

"Ne iru milde en tiun bonan nokton."

Say this with me ...

Relax, Regulus. I will tell you, but not here.

You've braved the "Storm." My experiment succeeded. Thank you for your help.

...

And you survived.

It's alright. It's just ... the end of an era.

Hold my hand. Let me take you into the suitcase.

Close your eyes.

Follow me. All the way down to the end of the path and into the depths.

Hide it in the tree hole this time. It shouldn't be that easy to be found.

The subculture movement has indeed changed the social status of some arcanists. While in the 1920s ... there are still many injustices.

... Mr. APPLe, how long will it take for the suitcase to be completely invisible?

Regulus?

Regulus?

There is only echo.

And no sign of Regulus.

No one's here. The light is off. Did she go to another room?

Someone is singing at the lake. The sound carries into the room faintly.

Regulus! Why are you there?

The outside scenery keeps changing and changing …

What has remained unchanged for ages is the lake and an old spinning wheel.

...!

Her voice doesn't sound right.

I should go and take a look.

This is my suitcase. Please give it back to me.

If they shake the suitcase like this, Regulus will probably fall apart.

Mr. APPLe, I need your help.

... Hm?

Sonetto?! Why are ... Is it because I touched ... that line?

What?!

Why did you all black out?

What happened? I don't seem to be affected ...

On the lake, the spinning wheel is still shimmering.

Hmm ...

I should come back and check again later.

While Sonetto is immersed in the joy of the reunion, someone is snoring nearby.

This is where Vertin has never been.

Regulus! Regulus!

I can't see her at all ... The fog is getting thicker …

Vertin goes closer and finds half a spinning wheel in the middle of the lake, with strange threads on it.

... The line is two-dimensional?

More and more water rises.

The ground is covered with rainwater from the "Storm." Incredibly, the water has no weight, or humidity. It just flows slowly and quietly, like time.

Time ...

I seem to have seen this ... It's ... I …

The line in her hand, technically the line-like thing in her hand which cannot be felt in any way, has gradually formed a path in her sight.

And someone is going to be invited over.

Please allow me to re-introduce myself.

I'm from the St. Pavlov Foundation—the same place as the investigators you just met. We actually grew up there together.

I am the Timekeeper. I keep track of time in the outside world.

A safe place. An "ark" ... sailing in the "Storm."

No one can follow us here. We can speak freely.

... That is to say, I am the one who records the beginnings and ends of eras.

... That is to say, I am the one who records the beginnings and ends of eras.

Yes. I took this photo several days ago. He was selling Hoover upright vacuum cleaners in the West End and thought photos would help business, so he gladly posed for it.

...

This is Marion Smith, a single mother. She worried if she could afford to feed her child every night, but she never gave up her dream of being a writer.

I met her at a snack bar at 2 a.m. Her one-act play about the Trans-Antarctic Expedition was a real masterpiece.

This is Julie, who once invited me to her house. Her bedroom wall was covered with posters of Rivaldo ...

... the FIFA World Player of the Year, who then became a mass idol.

They're stories from a long, long time to come.

These photos date forward to 1999. My time.

... That is to say, I am the one who records the beginnings and ends of eras.

Our time is going backwards, Regulus.

At the countdown to the millennium, before the clock struck twelve, time reversed. We were sent back to the explosion of the supernova in the 80s, to the release of VHS ...

Maybe.

I doubt I'll ever see them again.

Before meeting you, I had done so many experiments.

At one point, I discovered that my suitcase was able to cut the "Storm" out. It can preserve items from the last era too, like these photos.

So I tried putting newspapers, mushrooms, even Wapaloosies into the case. They all succeeded. However, when it came to the friends I had made in the last era ...

I failed.

It doesn't work on ordinary people.

Maybe I should just record the time ... Be a silent, emotionless observer ... Act as the Foundation has asked me to.

I think so.

When you were out at sea, broadcasting on the radio, Regulus cried out, "Shout it to the full moon!"

It was the beginning of the month. There couldn't have been a full moon that day. The real moon was to your west ... There were two that night.

I realized that you could see what I see in this world. So ...

I decided to try it again.

One last time.

Not good. Seems our suitcase has been found.

By critters maybe, or just someone passing by. Sorry, I need to leave for a while. Need to hide it somewhere safe.

...

This is my own will.

I can't stand aside and watch you be taken away by Sonetto; have you disappear like the others in the "Storm."

There's also something I need to find out for myself ...

.. and to the 1960s, where I met you.

... The truth.

This is where Vertin has never been.

Regulus! Regulus!

I can't see her at all ... The fog is getting thicker …

Vertin goes closer and finds half a spinning wheel in the middle of the lake, with strange threads on it.

... The line is two-dimensional?

More and more water rises.

The ground is covered with rainwater from the "Storm." Incredibly, the water has no weight, or humidity. It just flows slowly and quietly, like time.

Time ...

I seem to have seen this ... It's ... I …

The line in her hand, technically the line-like thing in her hand which cannot be felt in any way, has gradually formed a path in her sight.

And someone is going to be invited over.

... Hm?

Sonetto?! Why are ... Is it because I touched ... that line?

What?!

Why did you all black out?

What happened? I don't seem to be affected ...

On the lake, the spinning wheel is still shimmering.

Hmm ...

I should come back and check again later.

The sound of water is left behind her.

...

...

Let me explain. Regulus, APPLe, what I invited you to join before is ... the St. Pavlov Foundation.

As for Dr. Papper, I think Sonetto will find a way.

…

……

...!

I'm coming.

You are awake ... How do you feel? Any discomfort?

I'm sorry ...

...

The Foundation is currently the charity that can provide the best treatment for arcanists. There is no doubt about it.

Every few years, the Foundation selects talented arcanists from children around the world.

They go to orphanages and admonition centers, and even fish out unique ones from the prisons in detention centers.

I was also one of them. Since I can remember, I know it very well that I am alone.

Until 1999, when the first "Storm" came ...

I ... I seem to see my mother.

...

All of us ... our memories of 1999 are blurred. I can only remember that she was placed on a laboratory bed, surrounded by many medical staff.

They shouted her name and mine. ... And I can't remember anything else. Later, no matter how hard I tried to ask, the official answer I got was always "No such person".

I have no intention to make enemies of the Foundation ... As I said, I just want to find out the truth ... all the truth about 1999.

...

I know what you said to Sonetto just now is expedient. I can still help you get out of here.

So you mean ...

Then come back as soon as you finish the registration. The Foundation is open to public, but it's still heavily guarded.

I'm sorry ...

... I was not sure.

I'm sorry ...

... So, you have seen what the "Storm" was like?

...

Thank you for bringing the message, Sonetto.

So, what's the first mission for our team?

Rescue the arcanists?

I see.

The forces of the Manus expand dramatically year by year. To stop the trend, we do need additional manpower.

But ... Sonetto, did you have oranges just now? There is a scent of orange on the capsule.

Maybe that's my mistake. If there is no question, we are ready to go ...

... We should go. I will carry it with me along the way.

But Regulus ...

It's fine.

They won't know.

How's it going?

It will probably take some time for them to wake up. Hide them under the car first.

We don't have much time. Let's hurry to the hidden position. ... Mr. APPLe, why are you a little upset?

There're still 30 minutes. Who's coming early ...

Pap, pap, pap.

... Damn it. Let's go!

How's it going?

Enough.

Those unconscious arcanists behind you ... are the original victims, right?

You are bringing them back to Manus Vindictae?

Answer my question.

... Difference in talent is never, and never will be the reason to deprive people of life.

...!

Wait.

There's an address on the seal—Polypotion Bar, The Walden.

Sonetto, update the result to the headquarters.

Let's move on to the next destination.

The Walden ... It may have the answer to all the questions.

Speaking of which, Sonetto, have you ever heard of a ghost story about "fire"?

Oh. So it is said that in the early 20th century, there was a devastating forest fire in Washington.

Those who died unfortunately did not want to leave, and they turned into dark ghosts in the woods.

They follow the travelers without making any sounds, and in order to see everyone's face clearly, they will …

Lots of unknown creatures! Sonetto, stay behind me!

Everybody, get ready to fight!

No, too many of them. We can only take one round at most, not for long.

Coming again. Careful!

Yes.

Let's go, Mr. APPLe.

... It's a good thing.

Maybe we covered Sonetto.

As long as one of us can leave the woods, there's hope for the rest.

Too late to climb up the slope. Get ready to fight!

Mr. APPLe, how much longer can you hold on?

... The heels ... here you are.

Please allow us to assist you!

Thank you very much for your help, Ms. Druvis.

Yes.

The exit on the northwest ... It's quite close to The Walden on the map.

What is the Storm Gathering?

Stock? Why does it always have something to do with financial securities ...

...

You are not going?

Hello. Please get me Madam Z of St. Pavlov Foundation Committee.

I require access to the historical intelligence on the U.S. financial market in 1929, specifically the date of the Wall Street stock market crash, and how much arcanum was involved in the methods of stock exchange.

... Also, I request sending backup to reinforce the Storm Gathering tonight. Casual wear required.

Hmm ...

The Manus is changing history, Madam Z.

Copy that.

Hello. Please get me Madam Z of St. Pavlov Foundation Committee.

Copy that.

Thanks for coming to assist.

I just don't feel good about this. Hopefully it's my misjudgment. Is everyone in position?

... They are crazy.

Got it. Let's head down to The Walden now. You follow APPLe. Remember, to stay low profile.

Did you find out the relationship between Manus Vindictae and him?

It's her?!

S**t!

... I'm going. Don't worry.

You've been there? The scent of orange on Sonetto's mission capsule ... That's why you can hijack the hostages outside the parking?

Thanks for coming to assist.

Why did you go to the Foundation? Can't the Manus give you what you want?

What if I say, I can provide you with the shelter?

...!

Ugh!

The market is really dropping ahead of time. To accelerate the history like this ... is that for ...

I'm fine. Why are you ... behind the stage? You seem well. Thank goodness.

Those behind him ... are men of the Manus Vindictae!

...

Correct. I finally got the answer.

Those behind him ... are men of the Manus Vindictae!

I finally got the answer.

You are using history to expedite the "Storm."

Community conflicts, turbulent history, new technology ... all of these may lead to the "Storm."

Since the last day of 1999, the world has started to get reversed by the "Storm," one after another.

Which past do you want to return? Fifty years ago? A century ago? Or ...

I finally got the answer.

I finally got the answer.

They've re-constructed the building. All the exits are blocked.

We can't keep fighting like this. We need to find a way out ...

The hidden path they just made? ... That may work.

Leave four behind for the team! Everyone else move! Don't get caught!

They've made an underground labyrinth in the speakeasy! The end of the labyrinth, what will that be?

Ok. Then ...

... Is Schneider casting an arcane skill ...?

She is near us ... but why can I sense that ...

No, it's nothing. You make the call.

There will be many unexpected dangers in the labyrinth. We need to move carefully.

... Is Schneider casting an arcane skill ...?

Yes. I heard the sounds of the street.

Can you find her position?

We're here to help. Stay calm, miss.

Uggh ... Let go ...

Mr. APPLe! The "Heaven Apostle"!

...!

In the blink of an eye, she is now standing in front of them.

Judging from her speed of approaching and the range of her arcane skill, it won't make any difference even if all of them manage to escape from the bar.

Only four are left inside the wall.

Go. Run freely.

Leave the rest to me.

Vertin and Schneider gently push them out of the exit.

...

The next moment, the wall has collapsed, blocking the only way out.

Let's see what a good match we are.

It's win or die.

Sonetto is trying hard to maintain balance at the exit while carrying Marian on her back.

Vertin and Schneider gently push them out of the exit.

...

Hello.

...

The leader behind Manus Vindictae.

Why?

Do I have the right to say no?

So, what are the three questions?

And how do you indulge in my suffering?

...!!

Wha-what? The Foundation ...

Isn't the "Storm" created by you ...

Schneider!!

Yes. We are looking for the arcane antibody immune to the "Storm" ...

And I am the only successful subject.

Asymmetric ... Immune Protein G ...

...

...

...

I will join you ...

...

... I rarely meet them. Most of them are deserted.

In the mental hospital, the correctional institution, the abandoned orphanage, and the streets that no one sets foot on.

... A great one.

I don't need it!

...!

Why? I've decided to join you!

The three questions are all done. It's already ... already enough!

... Orange?

Why oranges here ...?

Why oranges here ...?

Schneider? How did you become ... so young ...?

Where ... where am I?

The orange tree feels so real—the warm breeze, the familiar scent ...

... I'm here to pick oranges.

Eh hey.

Eh hey.

Ah, thank you for wiping the mud off my face.

Who says I'm not skilled? Observe. Let me pick up that big orange at the top for you.

Just climb up here, take a small jump ... then I'll get it ...

... Hey! I got it!

... Hey! I got it!

... Hey! I got it!

Pap! Pap! Pap!

...

You often see strange creatures ... Are you also an arcanist?

Ah, the critters are making trouble now! Wait a minute. I will deal with them soon.

I ... I think I just saw a critter ... Didn't watch my step when driving it away.

I don't feel like it.

I've been wondering ... don't you think this orange ... tastes bitter?

Schneider?! Why are you covered in blood ...

The pistol ... no, no, no! Don't come over!

This is the final chance.

One shall fall, one shall stand.

Schneider dashes to Vertin, her chest bumping into the quivering pistol.

Pap!

Schneider?! Why ...!

I'm sorry.

...

...

...

The pistol ... no, no, no! Don't come over!

I'm sorry.

The pistol ... No, no, no! Don't come over!

In the future ... will you also come to town, Schneider?

...

The Storm Syndrome turned money into food in people's eyes ... It's so ridiculous.

Why do you blame them? In the "Storm," there is no life.

This burnt branch ... should have come from a rowan tree, right?

I have seen this tree in Ireland and southwest England. It is often called "Quickbeam," derived from Old German ... means "stay alive."

Rowan is full of vitality. Even if it is transplanted from Europe to North America, it grows vigorously and stretches into a vast forest.

However, an unexpected fire destroyed all of them.

Just like the "Storm." It's there for no reason.

People, like this branch, whose life was brutally terminated, they worked out new tools, they tried to eat the softened gold bars, and sold the food that's no longer valuable ...

People worked so hard to understand life with their own logic ...

because they just want to live as much as possible, but not go back in time.

Is this little rowan branch really alive, Ms. Druvis?

You used arcanum to keep it at the moment when it was burned.

Once you dispel the arcanum, it would not be what it is now. I think you are clear, Ms. Druvis, that ...

Every tree lives for tomorrow.

...

And this "mutation" has turned money into food in people's eyes ...

In the most dangerous days in the Celtic calendar, people would wear garlands and berries of rowan to pray for its blessing for vitality.

Uggh ... 

... Alright.

... Alright.

Only two are left at the large dining table.

Your wound hasn't healed. Can't get hurt anymore. Stay behind me!

This is a cage. She wants to catch us! The exit at two is our last chance! Breakthrough!

Uggh ...

It hurts ...

The slime on the thorns will make your body stiff. Be careful!

... No. We can't be trapped here. Let me try again!

Flamo Flicker!

Ugh!! ... It bounced back ...

How? How is the thorn cage so tough?!

Aferoj Away!

Umm ... 

Damn it! Why!

... I'm not sure.

... There must be a way. It just takes time.

What are you talking about?!

... I don't understand ...

It's too risky, and ...

But what you said ... She ...

She heard it all.

The second, the first, and underground—altogether three secret chambers in the speakeasy. There are mainly material rooms, study rooms, and corridor on the second floor. Cross out.

The most likely place to park Schneider ... should be in one of the rooms on the other two floors.

It's a pity that the patrolmen could not be confirmed. I'm afraid a battle will be inevitable.

Bring the healing potion, other potions, medical equipment, food, masks of the Manus, and ...

The rowan branch sprouted. The symbol of protection and blessing ...

I'll take it. Go.

It's weird. It was a straight path when investigating.

Hm? Someone's coming. I should hide from them. 

...?

Why ...? The rowan branch seems to be pulling me? Does it want me to choose the path where they are?

OK, then I'll wait for them to go over.

Both his appearance and voice have changed, just like the believers who can't talk ...

No, I can't stay any longer. I need to pass through here and go to the underground before anyone else comes.

"Mine hands, thine order." I am Vertin, a follower like you. Please let me pass.

He can't be talked into sense ... Is he moving just by instinct?

I can only stun you first! Sorry ... Mr. Robert.

Is it because of the mask? Or Arcana?

Footsteps. At least five or six people. I should go downstairs quickly.

The underground ... another turnoff!

The sprout is growing at an unbelievable speed. It seems to be leading the way.

So close. Just avoided another group of guards ... It's a wine room. Schneider is not here. Next ... 

This is ... a floating staircase going down?! Is there another fourth space?

The sprout is already of a finger's length. There is even a small bud on it. It points downstairs.

Fine. Last bet. I'll go down.

I found you ...

Schneider!

She is barely breathing.

Black bloodstains and feathers congeal into a silent figure.

Weak pulse ... How come? We should have time for first aid …

Schneider!

Thank goodness you're fine. Drink these.

And this. Eat. You must have been hungry for so long.

It's the leftover cake from dinner. I can't bring too much with me. Hang in for a while. They will send you out here tonight.

I just don't know ... How did you do that? When you bumped me ...

I didn't have the chance to talk to her alone. But I think, since I can meet you now, maybe ...

<i>tmr 10am. Heavy fog. Relief Shelter in the woods.</i>

Maybe she shares the same dream with us.

Schneider. Now you need to save your strength.

Don't open your eyes until you meet Sonetto.

I'll see you in the Relief Shelter.

The bullet did hit your chest.

Are you really showing me the way? Then ... I'll go left.

These powders are not poisonous.

Also the potion he's brewing doesn't do any obvious harm.

This smells nice. Even like ...

Why? Does he really want to treat the patients? Impossible.

...!

Relief supplies?!

So that's it ... Lots of reserved food and oil, medical supplies, emergency supplies, and temporary infrastructure tools …

Without official support, Manus Vindictae needs supplies to gain a foothold in different eras.

The so-called peace before the "Storm" is to cover up the transport of supplies!

No. Ten is too late. I must meet Sonetto before that!

It's a misunderstanding. I don't have the potion. It will be delivered very soon.

Can't be talked into senses, the tramp utters a cry.

Crap. Other people will be attracted here! I need to take him down ...  

... Sorry. Take a rest. You can no longer waste your energy like this.

An unguarded trail hides behind the bushes.

A smell of stale, burnt gasoline lingers.

Ms. Druvis ...

No. I'm picking them up.

... Yes.

Until we see "tomorrow" with our own eyes.

Will you come with me, Druvis?

What?!

He used the potion as fuel for explosion?

Druvis! Druvis ...!

Druvis! Druvis ...!

Enough! Don't live in the past!

Open your eyes!

Your blessing ... once brought me fortune and hope.

Now I will give this blessing to you. I will share my "tomorrow" with you.

Watch your steps. Leave with me!

Leave the flashlight. Get up. I'll carry you and jump out!

Forget Me Not, sooner or later, you will be destroyed by your own hatred.

...

Your good luck won't last long.

Despite the coming "Storm," or the Foundation's reinforcements, there is only one ending to your story.

We belong to the future, Forget Me Not.

It's raining.

What comes after the rain, is a bottle of boiled water pouring down on him.

But he stands still.

Sonetto ... Regulus ...?

Your hands are trembling, Sonetto ...

Calm down. You did nothing wrong.

We are together now, aren't we? There are more challenges for us to take.

It's not the time to catch up.

We're in trouble ...!

Everybody, keep 50 feet away from her!

Correct.

And one day ... I will be back and beat you personally.

...

As she raises her hand, black slime gathers and becomes the disciples.

The enemy is coming! Everybody protect yourselves!

Other members of Manus Vindictae run to Arcana. They fade in the rain.

We can't relax yet. Defeat the shadows first! Please everybody hold on!

Finally ...

...

Whose people shall be no more ...?

...

There are ... six hours left ...

In the following time ... symptoms will get worse ...

The influence scope of the Storm Syndrome will be further expanded ...

How shall we spend ... the last hours? And what can I do?

How shall we spend ... the last hours? And what can I do?

Schneider ...

...?!

...?!

Sonetto ...

...

Yes.

Sonetto ...

This time, I want to hear everyone's wishes. 

Yes.

... If this was the last moment in your life ... what wish would you want to make? 

...

I think ... there is a way to address your problems, Mr. Karson.

Enjoy the dinner Ms. Sotheby prepares for everyone tonight.

... I didn't know you prayed.

You're the last one to tell me your wish.

... Although you won't go, I still want to know.

Well ...

...

The "Storm" is here.

The "Storm" is here.

...

... Goodbye.

... Goodbye.

Schneider ... I'm sorry.

Your family ...

...!

What do you mean? I-I don't understand ...

No!!! Why? ... You've never eaten the gold bar in front of us!!

Are you always tolerating it?!

Goodbye?! You mean the "Storm" will also ...

...

Sonetto!

Come here.

Is my book wall still there? She didn't push it down, right?

Phew ... she is nice. Unlike the bad potion instructor who turned my books into a puddle of mud ...

Oh, right! Guess what I found today?

Here, give me your hand.

Look, the foreteller of the rain—the Hyla arborea!

I caught it through the school's front gate. I even got stung by the electric fence when I took my hands back.

It keeps croaking in my pocket! Look, it's still raining outside.

...?

... Why? Just because the <i>Student Handbook</i> says so?

I don't like the handbook. It smells like those stinky socks in the attic.

Sonetto, aren't you really curious about what is outside the school?

You were also in that parade outside the school before ...

The pebbles, the frogs, the attic with stinky socks ... They're just a teeny tiny part of the whole world. I once met a girl who came to our school ...

...

Until the day we lose life itself ...

To death?

...

No.

I'm sorry. I just wanted to see you clearly since your speech was so wonderful.

... Any ... question?

...

What is the "Storm," sir?

May I ask ... how much further do we have to go?

Till we get to the guardhouse ...

Ok.

Ok.

I promise.

This is ...

The Shamir worm?!

So cool.

It's said that the Shamirs are marvelous creatures, even King Solomon searched for them for years. They are incredible engravers—more skilled than the greatest craftsman among human. They can engrave on leaves, metal, and gemstones, build a sacred temple, or destroy a giant vessel.

But now ... they have become tools for punishing naughty kids.

Urgh ...! It hurts.

There are at least a few hundred Shamirs here ... and they are all moving towards me.

The instructor did teach two incantations to repel insects, but Shamirs are not any ordinary worms. They are, in fact, a kind of advanced critter. The elementary arcane skills won't work on them ...

Let alone there are no signs of my arcanum abilities up till now ... Maybe, I'm not an arcanist at all ...

Ouch ...! Please don't bite me two times in a row!

No, stop, I have to focus now. There must be a way I can think of.

Water keeps dripping down from the side of the ceiling near the window. But, it hasn't rained for days.

Here is a thin layer of mud on the ground. Judging from its volume, it's not likely to be brought in by other children who were once here for confinement.

The dripping water has made the ground uneven. For these tiny worms, these descending areas are like impassable gulfs.

... Could the ground be left like this so as to slow down the worms and give us the time to cast incantations?

But why would they gather around my feet ...?

Hmm ... This is ...

Is this their food?

Turns out their route has been planned already.

Hop to there first.

Phew ... Weird, why no Shamirs here?

Hm? These things sticking to my shoe are ... oat brans?

I've jumped over here, but the Shamirs just keep crawling towards the grains.

Seems that they are not oriented by sounds. What matters to them is the grain.

But I can't stay here forever. There are foods in every corner. They will get here sooner or later.

Um, they can't do anything to this wool blanket?

Wool ...

Oh, so that's the case ...

The legend says that the way to store Shamir worms is to wrap them in wool and store them in a container made of lead,

which means the wall of this room should be made of ...

It's alloy. Quickly forming a film on the surface—this has to be Lead(II) carbonate.

This is poisonous to them ...

Well, to me, as well.

I have everything I need. Grains to lure them and wools to drive them away.

The solutions are more than I expected.

Alright, let's move! Expel them to the corner.

Finally, get them all to the corner.

...

I'm a bit hungry.

Oh right. I'll check what this padlock is made of and see if it can be consumed by the Shamirs ...

...

I see. With plenty of food on the ground, Shamirs won't notice the ironware hanging above.

Heh. Time to try a brand new dish, you old gentlemen.

... Who are you?

So cool!

Yes.

And so you can leave without a backward glance?

No way, then.

If I let you out, will you come back?

But if you don't come back, the instructor will give us a harsher punishment.

I'm just sneaking out for food. I'll be back.

What would you like to have?

No problem. I will bring some mashed peas too.

Yes. How about you? Any odd things in your room?

... I said "that word."

"That word." I said it at the pre-parade assembly.

*sighs* I don't understand ... It was he who said that I could ask any questions I want.

I heard it from the janitor of our dormitory. That was the last thing he said.

I saw him being escorted outside the school gate and onto a truck.

He screamed all along, "The 'Storm' is coming ... The 'Storm' is coming ..."

Er-m, I said it again ...

... Shoot.

... I asked many people, but none was bothered to answer. Uncle Morris said the janitor left the school at an inappropriate time and saw some inappropriate things, so he needed treatment.

What do you mean?

<i>THE WORLD-CHANGING "STORM": TRUTH COVERED BY THE FOUNDATION</i>?

It doesn't tell us exactly what "that word" is, either.

There's a line in bold at the end of the article ... "Welcome to Manus Vindictae"?

What’s Manus Vindictae?

Something has been printed on the back too. Hmm, let me see ...

Nor happiness, nor harmony, nor fame,

Nor pride, nor strength, nor skill in arms or arts,

Shepherd those herds whom blindness makes tame;

Hm ...?

Yes. Are you coming?

So that's what you mean ...

I don't care, Joseph. You can deal with it as you want.

I'm messing with you. How would you prove that I wrote it?

That's not what my writing looks like when I use my right hand.

And now you are the one holding the note—I could say it's you who wrote it, right?

I'll call the instructor over for you.

Um ...!

*coughs* ... I need to hide quickly ...

There's an empty classroom right next to her. A good place to hide.

The clamor subsides. The hallway restores its peace gradually.

At least there will be two ... I guess.

Isabella ...When she just got into the school, she was crying all the time and wanted to go home. Maybe she will come ...

But this is something no one can guarantee.

... It'd be good enough as long as none of the instructors show up.

They're ...

Mesmer Jr., Isabella, "Penny," Matilda ... You are all here.

Counting The Ring's classmates in, half of a class has gathered here.

They jump into the tree hole one after another; the spacious hole suddenly becomes rather crowded.

What ...?!

Absolutely not! I've never thought of that!

I didn't expect so many of you.

So many of you in school are just like The Ring and me ...

... want to know more about the things outside ...

Our life is all about training, peace, and mankind. Nothing else.

We have different hair colors, speak with different accents, and cast different arcane skills ...

But the<i> Student Handbook </i>asks us to forget about all these. It aims at eliminating our differences and ensuring conformity in the school. 

That poem inspired me with so many things ...

We are the chosen ones. We are meant to be the backbone of the primary defense for mankind.

But all of you here today ... Must still be curious about who you really are and what is in the world outside ...

We cannot leave here, but we can know the truth through another way.

Fellow students, before entering the school ... Where did you live? What kind of life did you lead?

Did people there cast incantations too? Did they like scone just as we do ...?

By piecing together our memories from all over the world, we can "rebuild" the very world outside!

...!

...

They may be upset, or blame us ...

But, let's give it a try!

In the darkness, their hands join in silence.

The song ... sounds much better than it was before.

...!

...

Were you on duty yesterday?

... Okay.

Doves are hovering above the square.

The principal walks onto the stage from the side stair—this can be clearly seen from the stage.

Yes.

Sir, please, listen to us.

Please, give us a chance. Let us be ... let us be ourselves.

... Isabella!!

Isabella looks at her. This tiny girl gives her a sad smile while being pushed and pulled around by the guards by her side.

Protect Isabella!!

Step back! Step back! Protect yourself. Don't get hurt!

Listen, stand in circle, hand in hand! Short guys inside!

Watch out for the guard batons. Don't get hur ...

Pap!

I'm fine. It doesn't hurt so much now. It hurt more when the tear gas burnt me.

Sonetto drops her head. She seems out of words.

...

... Glad to hear you say so.

But we won't sing it anymore. I think other students are still locked in the guardhouse ...

...

Thank you for your kindness.

I hope they will have the chance to use them.

Hello, I'm here to return this book.

Thank you, instructor.

I will be on my way. Hope you have a wonderful day.

The librarian, with satisfaction, watches Vertin leave. She places the book on top of the stack located on a trolley.

<align="right">——"I have very important things to say to you."

<align="right">——"I've now obtained the map of the school, including the blocks around it. "


<align="right">——"But now we can't meet in public places, as there are students watching us."

<align="right">——"George the Oak was also zoned to the alert area. We need a new location for gathering. Better meet tonight."

<align="right">

It's alright, "Ring." What we're going to do this time ... is much more dangerous than last time, and we may lose everything we have ...

...

Look, this is the full map of our school, including the aerial view of the school and the blocks nearby.

I've found the technical drawings of the air defense renovation in the library and added the missing underground tunnel part to the map.

I didn't realize until I put all these together and found that the underground air-raid tunnel connects the northwest and southeast watchtowers. And the two first floors of these towers are the only two exits towards the outside world aside from the gate.

The safest plan is to go to the clinic through the girls' dormitory. There is only a door between the southeast watchtower and the clinic. Taking the Shamirs with us then we don't have to worry about the keys.

The map only shows the blocks outside the southeast watchtower. I noticed that there are many options for transportation in the neighborhood, easy for escape.

The number of Olitiaus has recently increased. Airdropping packages with various stuff ...

Maps, newspapers headlining Foundation Cover-ups, survival guides ... they even dropped some field rations recently.

By coincidence or not, I think this "Manus Vindictae" is helping us all the time ...

Yes, we should!

Good, then this is it.

Prepare food and clothes ... The "break-away" action starts a week later from now!

What's wrong? Matilda, you look like you're crying.

Matilda ...

We won't force you to do anything you don't want to. After all, we're here because ... we are longing for freedom.

We once fought side by side. That would be enough.

Oh, by the way, could you tell our plan to Mesmer Jr. for me? She is one of us too. I don't want to leave her behind.

Change of plan. Emergency, change of plan!

Years after, when I think of that escape ...

Still feels like I was in a chess game, playing against an invisible enemy.

Back then, I knew nothing about chess, nor resigning, let alone the fact I was in the zugzwang.

It's impossible to go to the clinic through the girls' dorm. The clinic is now crowded with people, and we must give up the road to the southeast watchtower.

We have another option: to go to the classroom first, then enter the air-raid tunnel from the library.

Exactly. Once we get down to the tunnel, we will be much safer. Have you left the window open on the first floor?

The most dangerous part is from the dorm to the library. Not only will we pass the classroom, but also be exposed under the surveillance of the central watchtower.

Ok. Now split up. Once the central watchtower's lights is out, we move. I will see you under the A12 window of the library.

And these crystal earrings are gifts from Matilda before I left.

Wear these and we can hear each other within a certain distance.

That's all. Be careful. I will see you soon!

Copy. Be careful. Keep in touch.

People in the classroom, distract them.

...! Fuse box tripped?! Now is the time! Go!

Everyone, go to the library now!

It's difficult to sneak out of the dorm at this time ... Isabella, if we get stopped by the supervisor, be prepared for conflict.

Heads down, stay low ... Don't get caught ... hm?

Great. Go!

Amazing, everything is going so well today. You keep watching. We will be right there!

According to the map, we are now out of the library. Keep going, everyone!

No, it's thunder.

It's about to rain.

Everything goes so well today ... too well maybe, making me uneasy.

What's wrong!

You are ... air force from Zeno! What are you doing here?

... 

She is a soldier with field experience. If we can't take advantage within the first few rounds ...

You guys retreat immediately, and I'll cover for you. As long as one of us can get out of school, our plan succeeds.

...

...! Sonetto! Why are you here ...

She walks up to Vertin and yet doesn't respond to her question. She pulls out her wand and stands before Lilya.

...

We're leaving, Sonetto.

Thank you for your assistance. Goodbye.

Yes.

We have prepared for everything that could happen. No regrets.

...

We chose a different future.

But future has no right or wrong, Sonetto.

Go back. Get yourself out of these things.

Don't let down your guard. Let me see.

It's an ordinary iron gate. Through that door frame, everything on the first floor of the northwest watchtower is plainly presented.

In the oval-shaped room, they see a wall phone, a coat rack, and some randomly hunched batons.

No signs of people on the first floor. Behind the shutters, lightning flashes and thunder rumbles outside.

... That's the gunfire for freedom.

...

You're right.

Ha ...

The first thing that comes to her senses is a moist, complex smell, coming from various kinds of food.

Then a loud thunder.

Like a celebratory salute ...

Meanwhile, people's clothes fall to the ground like confetti.

At last, a scratchy sound, like something ferrous, falls on the ground.

...?

...!

But the conflict has been there all the time.

And it only grows.

The group that believes in "mankind supremacy" is splitting the Foundation's belief apart.

The conflicts cannot be covered by regulations anymore, Madam Z.

The "Storm" has been here for 8 years. None of the people who are left behind can shake off the influence it brought.

Human technologies are being reversed, while arcanum is blooming.

The unexpected first "Storm" brought more than half of the Foundation's elite members away from us. The number of staff of the House of Integratus and the Committee cannot compare with that of their heyday even now.

In order to contend against Manus Vindictae, we have kept absorbing arcanists from the outside world ... However, the dissenting voices have only grown louder ...

Loud enough to be heard, and have become a faction that couldn't be shaken—the Mankind Caucus.

Beyond their control, these new arcanists only brought fear. They demand an unchallengeable power to make decisions and a harsher control of arcanists.

Madam Z, I don't want my friends or me to be the sacrifice of this conflict ... As we were four years ago.

A neutral, safe, and legitimate place for us.

I don't know whose side you are on. But I believe the future you pursue doesn't end up with the Foundation being split apart by factional conflict.

That's what I learnt from that stormy night.

Your eyes told me ...

... you didn't belong to that chess game.

No matter what your decision is ... thank you.

Hello.

Yes. Here are their background reports I wrote for your perusal.

This is Sotheby. A well-educated lady born in a traditional arcanist family.

She comes from an extremely privileged background. Her family had a special influence around the world.

Besides, she has limited social skills and scientific knowledge. It will be difficult to assimilate her.

Mr. APPLe, under his modest and gentle appearance, lies a sharp perception by nature.

Being so erudite, he always has his own views of our historical intelligence.

As far as I know, he remains upset about Captain Regulus's involuntary affiliations with the Foundation.

While Regulus has never been truly accepted by the Foundation.

She has missed out all the education and training a member of the Foundation should have received. The influence left by the outside world on her is like a banner among the ordinary staff in the Foundation. A banner way too salient.

Once the banner was held up, new arguments were raised, and thus exacerbated the factional conflict inside the Foundation.

...

...

L- ... Lilya ...?

Urgh ...

...

What good weather.

My friends.

Hmm ...

The wind feels ... so good ...

Are they alright?

Haha ...

...

Thank you. Thank you all.

Yes. Everything is going to be alright.

What are we doing next?

I'm fine. Fit as a fiddle.

Just a bit of headache, nothing else.

It's good to see you again.

Thank you for being here ... being around me.

...!

May I ask what good news?

...

Thank you for telling me this.

What do you mean?

Hm. Prepare the Teleport soft disk.

I see.

I have a question for you, Sonetto.

Hmm.

In the Field Mission Evacuation Instructions, apart from the part about "asking the Timekeeper for help" …

Is there anyone else we can reach out to for rescue?

Well, she did try her best to pick the music.

Though no one is in the mood, I think this piece is not bad.

As to Regulus's question ...

We need to slightly twiddle this knob.

To ... 1913.

This is ...

I can apply for a ship for you, but it's not guaranteed.

I see. I have only one question.

Are you still our point of contact for the Foundation, Madam Z?

Then I have no further questions.

Okay.

That base the Manus used to keep its Olitiaus four years ago. It has never been reversed by the "Storm."

I'd like to investigate that place again.

It used to be the nest of Olitiaus, a kind of creature resting in valleys with abundant water resources.

What's more, it's winter now.

You're not planning on destroying this place now, are you, Regulus?

Ms. Moissan, welcome to the team. Madam Z said you're an excellent tutor in arcanum.

According to Madam Z, Ms. Moissan used to be Sotheby's private teacher.

There might be some clues that are invisible.

Regulus is a specialist in optical arcane skills, maybe she can find something.

I see. Do you mind us investigating this place? It won't be long.

Wait a second, Regulus.

Show me the thing in your arms.

No, the supply box.

It has my name on it.

As far as I know, no one is called by that name but me.

Regulus, wait, don't …

What ...

End of the 20th century ... Voice of the Millennium ...

Is this radio broadcasting news in 1999?

Ms. Moissan, watch your six! Let us help you!

The "era" of 1929 only lasted for two days. The frequent change of time muddles work and responsibilities in the Foundation, which in turn caused some chaos within it.

Luckily, Ms. Moissan noticed the signs of it at the beginning.

This is ...

The Manus mask they used to stay immune to the "Storm"?!

...!

Does that mean it'll be possible for the Scientific Computing Center to develop protective gears which are immune to the "Storm," like the Manus does?

I'll be careful. Thank you, Mesmer.

...

How do you feel now? I'm sorry about what happened in the rehab center.

...

That'll be the next thing to find out in our investigation, I think.

Manus Vindictae always has more information on the "Storm" and how to be immune to it. We've been trying our best to keep up with their progress.

Fortunately, now we have another direction.

Thank you, Sonetto.

With these files and the help of Regulus ... That should be enough.

This interrogation won't get us anywhere.

Laplace didn't detect any unusual arcane marks on her.

Yes, I understand what you mean. But for now, the evidence can't support our speculation.

A field trip may be helpful, I guess.

What's your plan? Will you come with me?

I've informed Madam Z. This will be the first official field mission of our team.

Sotheby and Druvis are still on leave. They will not take part in this action.

While Ms. Moissan will stay put in the Foundation's headquarters as our contact.

...

The Apollo Star we just heard about means the sun. The Ford Sextant Model T is an arcane device produced in the early 19th century. The Scientific Computing Center has one of those as a part of their collection.

The Gorgon Current is mostly created in the Aegean Sea, near the Balkan Peninsula. I remembered an arcanum magazine in the 1970s had a detailed article about this and introduced the circulating current. I read it in the periodical room in SPDM.

The current will be flowing backwards every time the Earth is at aphelion and perihelion. This is also known as the Current Reversal.

Which is on the third day of January and July this year.

And the time in the outside world is ...

January 1st, 1914.

...

Regulus, you've been longing for a ship, haven't you?

What if I tell you that I have got you one?

What a familiar name.

It's not working. I've tried different ways, but the tempest blocked every signal I sent for help.

Wait, there might be another way.

I'm sorry, Ms. Radio. I need to borrow you for a second.

Field Mission Evacuation Instructions, Article 21 ...

"Whenever there is an emergency, the field officer may send an SOS code with their wands through any transmission device with round buttons on it."

"Any Foundation member nearby will provide immediate humanitarian aid."

"To send the code, please turn the knob one time to the right, half to the left, and then one time to the right."

If you succeed, you shall hear ...

Thank you so much! We are ...

We were under attack by a giant sea monster when sailing in the Gorgon Current. Please help us ashore safely!

Not good! It's crawling into the cabin!

It plans to tear the ship apart from the inside! Everyone, watch ...

Pardon me?

Are you talking about my pocket watch?

I, I don't understand.

Do you mean this is the right time?

...!

You are saying we are in 2007?

Do you know the "Storm"?

I don't understand.

I'm Vertin.

Have you seen my companions?

What?

I'll ask something else instead. What is this place?

What island?

Huh! Maybe another question.

Did a biographer named Urd visit here before, in 1999?

Sorry to interrupt, but I only meant to ask about Urd, the biographer. She had been here on this island and written a travel note called Roaming in Apeiron.

Does the name or the book ring a bell?

Fragments of ... Matters?

You've also been incredibly helpful, Regulus.

You rebuilt my confidence in communicating with people.

Have you seen Sonetto and the others?

Sonetto, these people are ...?

What if we know about the Emanation?

We are the investigators from St. Pavlov Foundation. We are glad to share the information about the "Storm" or the Emanation.

Please grant us entry to this island so that we can share them.

I'll explain to you later. Trust me, please, Sonetto.

It's clear then.

"Real numbers" refer to arcanists, and "imaginary numbers" mean humans.

So it's not determined by our lineage, or Regulus would have been an integer, too.

But they use modern mathematical terms, and that girl talked about Kaprekar—he was an Indian mathematician active in the first half of the 20th century.

I think they are not living in complete isolation. They are still in contact with the outside world.

...

This place wouldn't be affected by the "Storm," just like the Olitiau base, Foundation headquarters, and my suitcase.

The travel notes in 1999, Manus Vindictae showing up in Olitiau's base, the "Storm," or Emanation ... They must be somehow connected.

And we'll find our answer here, I think.

This is not good. We need to separate them.

This is an archaic arcanist group we're dealing with. I assume they have their own reason for these.

So that's what their judgment is based on.

This is not good. They seem dangerous. Regulus, come to my side!

The arcane skills cast by the congregation on this island are very different from those we have seen.

Mr. APPLe is with Regulus. She won't be in danger for now.

Let's follow Sophia.

No problem. Ms. Sophia, could you give us some privacy?

No, I'll come with you, Sonetto.

I can't sense any sign of arcane skill on this stone. The oath is more of a formality than a curse.

But when Sophia repaired the floor in front of us with her arcane skill ...

There's no fluctuation of arcane power, either. I can't even sense the slightest signs.

It's either a kind of arcane skills we're not able to detect ...

Or, the moment we stepped onto this island ...

I know, Sonetto.

But as long as we obey their rules, we won't get into other trouble.

The doctrine of the Apeiron is to live in solitude and seek nothing but the truth. In fact, they've never been aggressive towards us.

Yet we haven't spotted any traces of the Manus here.

Which means we need to find out the truth.

... I wish to be baptized in the water of Gnosis, and be rid of the long darkness of ignorance.

... I choose to leave the fragments of Matters behind me, and enter the great hall of Forms as clean as a newborn.

... I swear to reveal no secrets ...

Get ready to run, Sonetto.

The Abraxases are coming.

...

I apologize, Ms. Sophia.

I won't defend our behaviour.

These files are …!

But won't you be in trouble for helping us?

Does that mean you will help us?

What chance?

I'd be glad to give this chance to you.

Sonetto ...

What? It's valid?!

I see. So that's how it works.

Relax. I will help you.

I—object!

Ah!

There is no time left.

Ah! Sonetto!

Thank you.

...

I've heard your preachment—pretty demagogic.

I'm sorry.

What do you mean?

It doesn't seem like trouble to me.

...!

...

I appreciate that.

I'll sign it.

The peace agreement ...

She's doing "well," thanks to you.

...

But Schneider should be the victim of a merciless bullet?

...!

...

What's Manus Vindictae's purpose to be here?

...

A wooden box in the Olitiau's base has my name on it.

Was that your doing?

...

It's burning.

I heard that you've completed all the lessons on the scripture.

This laurel wreath suits you well.

That was not your fault, Sonetto. It is now behind us.

I need to tell you something more important.

I've signed a peace agreement with Arcana, and the price of breaking it is ... death.

Yes. She put it on without hesitation.

But I don't think her purpose would be as simple as "hearkening the ancient wisdom."

I attacked Manus followers earlier, as 37 asked me to, but I received no punishment from the bangle.

Perhaps this island makes its own judgment on what to be classified as hostility … Like it has a mind of its own.

Sonetto, do not report this to the headquarters before we figure out how the bangle works.

After all, there are many other things to investigate on this island other than Manus Vindictae.

I tried to collect some samples last night in the outer region of the island.

But the detecting device showed nothing. If we were to find out more, we have to go to the centre area ...

...!

Lilya? Didn't you say you have Regulus with you safely?

...

Do we have to go through this debate again?

Forget it?

Haven't you been to school, Regulus?

...!

We are counting on you, Sonetto.

I have a feeling …

We are coming closer to a big secret.

Why do you keep referring to the "Storm" as the Emanation?

What does the Emanation mean?

Can you fix an IDM, Regulus?

Every record here can perfectly match what is in the Foundation's files.

Wait. These are the records before 2003, you say?

But this one refers to the "Storm" in 1966, which happened recently!

You made such a precise prediction even without leaving the island! Huh, that's incredible!

37, where is your mother now?

...

The "Form" you said ... 37, what is it?

37, we see the "Storm" very differently.

Among all the other things, we saw it, first of all, as a disaster.

...

I'm sorry for mentioning your mother.

I don't get it.

Why did you say my number is 0?

210 told me numbers imply our fate.

This is indeed an extreme comment.

What about your number? What does 37 mean?

No, it's not junk.

I think I know why your model didn't work.

Manus Vindictae has changed history.

They accelerated history, forcing historical events to happen earlier than it was supposed to; thus, the "Storm" in 1929 occurred sooner than it should ...

I'm telling the truth, 37. I've been there, in the "Storm" of 1929.

Your model was not wrong. You just missed some key information.

You've never been to the place where the "Storm" falls and thus know nothing about the symptoms of the Storm Syndrome ...

... and the true purposes of Manus Vindictae.

I swear I wasn't lying.

37, wait. I remember Sophia once told us that trespassing on the sacred place is a serious crime.

Hold there. Something is coming out.

They're coming for us.

Regulus, prepare for battle!

Ah!

The stone bangle is activated? But they are just Abraxas.

Regulus, wait for their attack! Do not kill them!

Listen to me, Regulus, that's of prime importance!

These are not the same kind of Abraxas as we've encountered before. Do they have different varieties?

Wait a second, Regulus.

Do you sense anything familiar in the fog?

That's the same fog in the Olitiau's base.

Don't rush to conclusions. Follow 37 first.

Oh, and what's that Ceres you were talking about?

What book is it?

You want to read these books here?

Be careful, Regulus.

The "Storm," the Emanation, the Storm Syndrome.

Where are they from?

Foundation, Manus Vindictae, Apeiron.

What roles do they play?

Why does the "Storm" fall when history trembles?

Why doesn't the "Storm" fall into the misty land?

What is the ingredient of "asymmetrical nuclide R" ...

...

I ...

... It's burning!

What's going on?

Is somebody fighting with the Manus now?

What's happening outside the cave?

Ah!

Huh?!

37? 37?!

What happened? Were all those illusions?

If it weren't for the heat of the stone bangle that wakes me up, would I go as crazy as they did?

...

This stone reminds me of the spinning wheel.

The collector of "asymmetrical nuclide R" ...

If the reagent turns gold after reacting with the fog here, that means ...

The fog contains elements that can be immune to the "Storm."

The color changed faster than I thought.

The concentration of R is hundreds of times, no, thousands of timeshigher than in the Manus's masks.

...

In other words, whoever owns this cave can produce the protective equipment of the "Storm" in big numbers.

Is that the reason why Arcana is here?!

I need to take 37 out of here.

So the Abraxases were people from the Manus.

The fog here can affect people's minds, like those around the lake in my suitcase.

Have the Manus found a way to launch attacks without being punished by the bangle?

Or, don't they care about the "price" they will be paying anymore?

I hope Regulus didn't throw my words to the wind.

I have to get rid of them first and go out to join the others!

And how do I submit my proof?

The cave is the key to being immune to the "Storm."

There is a cave on this island which has the same effect as my suitcase. That's what the Manus are after!

No! 37! NO!

Thank you for your mediation within the committee. I think you're right.

Sending more people to the island will only exacerbate the trust issue. They don't trust us, and that's what Arcana wants.

Things have just got better, and we can't let anything else upset this delicate balance.

I think ...

If we somehow can't come to an agreement with the Apeiron, we should at least prevent them from allying with the Manus in turn.

Come in please.

May I have some more paper?

Thank you, Ms. Marta.

Don't you want to ask me what I'm writing letters for?

The Foundation is negotiating with the outside world. They're trying to resolve this unfounded territorial dispute peacefully.

We've yet to reveal the coordinates of the island, and don't want to exacerbate the conflict.

Could you convey our sincere intentions?

I don't understand.

"What really scared me was not the threat to my life, but the possibility of dying ignorant."

...

Nothing's happening?

My apologies.

I swear on the Stone of Truth that I have no knowledge of the leak.

We never gave any information to the humans. As we speak, the St. Pavlov Foundation is taking measures to mediate the territorial disputes from outside the island.

Right.

37?

...!

It's the "Storm."

The "Storm" of this era is here.

More precisely, its 24-hour countdown has begun.

There's always a buffer period before the "Storm," during which the Storm Syndrome gradually spreads from the Critical Point across the globe. The symptoms are different every time, and we have yet to discern a pattern.

With the help of Laplace Scientific Computing Center, the best we can do now is to send a 24-hour warning prior to the "Storm."

Another minute has passed.

...!

Is that the Storm Syndrome?

888, stop conversing with him!

We must subdue him, now!

He has the Storm Syndrome!

Please, listen, everyone. 37 is right. Something's changed on this island. Your immunity to the "Emanation" has been weakened!

No, 37 didn't cause this. I told you. It was Manus Vindictae!

They broke the peace agreement and launched suicide attacks. They forced their way into the cave.

That's ...

...

I respectfully accept your verdict.

...!

...

I also agree with your verdict.

He purged the Storm Syndrome with an arcane skill?!

I never thought it'd be possible.

...

Thank you for your thoughtful consideration.

This era ...

The immunity hasn't "disappeared." It's just waning. For now, only the beach has lost the effect. We're still safe around the Hall of Apeiron.

Sonetto and I talked about this. We think the island is protected by a large-scale arcane ritual.

The sudden decay of the island's "Storm" immunity might be the result of its changes, though I'm unsure of the specifics.

6 has gathered all integers after the assembly. They're going to perform a mass cleansing ceremony.

37 also mentioned a test. I think they have more than one way to deal with the changes.

Yes. 6 gave us two hours to leave. That is to say ...

We must set out when the "Storm" countdown reaches 20:00.

Yes. I can feel it.

It would scald me whenever I thought about going to war with them.

We are discussing how to leave this place, 37.

Right.

Me? Where are we going?

It's okay, Regulus. I think I'll be safe there.

But 37, isn't this a sacred test for your people? I have never taken the oath. I'm not one of you.

...

Thank you both. I'm ready.

Before we go, 37, I have a question.

You just said that Apeiron will grant an answer to whoever passes the test.

Will It answer my question?

If I asked for a way to become immune to the "Storm"?

I don't understand, 37. This place was different the last time we were here.

But weren't those labyrinth walkers offerings to the Minotaur?

...!

Careful, 37!

The numbers are coming to life. We need to put them back in place!

Very well.

...!

No, 37, I think this question ...

...

No, I'm only thinking ...

What's the question you're going to ask? We've only got one chance.

About the "essence" of the "Emanation," right?

I think so?

So, are you going to ask something else?

I see.

I will stop here then.

No, I won't go far. I will wait for you here.

This is your gate to open. It is your question, your answer.

I will stay here and watch over you. If you encounter any danger in there, I will come to your aid at once.

No. I don't need to ask anymore.

The question you're going to ask, the one that will free us all from the "Emanation,"

is exactly the question I want to ask, 37.

See you soon, 37.

Will this really be the collapse of her world as she knew it, like 6 said? If that happens ...

I'll be here to hold the umbrella for her.

The ground is shaking.

Did she give the wrong answer?

37!

Stay with me! I'll get you out!

Is this 6's scroll?

What did you say? 37, are you feeling better now?

I am so proud of you, 37.

We will save everyone.

But there's one thing I don't understand.

6. His scroll saved your life.

Maybe he foresaw the dangers and protected you from it, so you can leave there almost unharmed.

But what was he trying to tell you,

when he warned you about "the collapse of your world as you know it"?

Hmm.

Where am I?

Did the earthquake do this?

I was in the cave with 37.

Is the timer broken?

Feast?

What?

Wait, Regulus! You just kicked over something.

Uhm!

No. None of this makes any sense.

A white rooster?

Something's not right. None of this is right!

Something's happened on the island. I must still be in the cave!

I have to get out of here!

37? Is that you?

Uhm!

...!!!

What did you dream?

Wait, 37!

...

What?

37. Things don't seem right out there.

No, 37. None of this was your fault. Hysteria has come to this island, and people are caught up in it.

It is the Storm Syndrome taking the form of "war."

Has it been six hours since we entered the cave?

That strange dream, it lasted longer than I thought.

This is bad. The plan we have with Zeno ...

37, I have to go.

May I know what happened during the cleansing ceremony?

37 and I each had a bizarre dream after the earthquake. Did everyone on the island fall asleep, too?

Upon our arrival, I sensed a large-scale ritual surrounding the island.

Is that the circle you kept talking about? Was it broken during the ceremony?

You have my word.

Because 6 stands for balance.

The "irrational numbers" that your people rarely appreciate—are they faced with a different path, a path of passion and madness?

I will stop Manus Vindictae.

The mask has robbed them of reason. There's no point in talking further.

Take 6 to safety, 37. I'm the one they are after.

I will meet with Sonetto at the square. Ms. Radio is with them, and we will contact our people from there.

Don't worry. We had a plan against the Manus, and we can still carry it out.

Now, on my mark ...

Run.

...

The Truth has not abandoned you, 37.

You haven't used the key yet, have you? It is still coded.

Lilya has verified Arcana's location. She is still on this island.

We still have a chance to stop her before it's truly too late.

We should go now, Sonetto.

We have 15 more hours until the "Storm."

...

I disagree.

The fragility and impermanence of sand is precisely why people strive for something eternal. Believing in perfection is not a flaw.

I noticed the human aircraft were loaded with weapons not from this era.

Did Manus Vindictae provide them with the technology?

I can't fathom your motives.

If you came here to incite hatred and recruit the pure-blood arcanists on this island, you may now walk away with satisfaction.

If you wanted to take the island as one of your bases, you could have done so after the cleansing ceremony failed.

But you did nothing. You just stood there. Why?

...!

...

Good!

Requesting to use the advanced arcane skill "Aferoj Around," No. 000262603100008,

to teleport a top priority threat to the Parmenides Base!

I have someone in mind that can help us decode faster.

But I need your approval before I ask them for help.

May I share the Truth with the others, 37?

No, we are not aware of that. 37 and I had just entered the cave when the investigator sent back the ritual.

I see. Thank you for the thorough explanation, Madam Lucy. I'll make sure to inform the members of Apeiron.

...

If possible, could you kindly explain this to them again after we set up the communication device?

I think so. No one in the Hall of Apeiron's affected by the Storm Syndrome so far.

The "immunity zone" seems stable for now.

Manus Vindictae and the humans have left. There should be no further destruction on the island.

Yes, and 37 also said the transcendental Truth was beyond the limits of her mortal flesh. Apeiron answered her with an eerie sound, one that could drive anyone mad just by hearing it.

It was then that the scroll 6 gave her unfurled and transcribed the sound into a string of numbers, providing us with the code.

Rosetta Stone?

You mean ...

It won't!

888, I won't let this happen. I promise.

Yes. What do you think, 37?

Isn't making use of it enough for our purposes?

First one's done, Mr. Ulrich.

...!

This incantation ...

No, it's just ...

I can read this language.

37, I think I know what it says.

It means "the first circle."

Then, the essence of this numerical code should also be a "circle," right?

If the experiment works, then the hypothesis is true. And vice versa.

I see what you mean here. It really is an easily provable hypothesis.

A knot ...

Great. Now there is only one step left: the verification.

Did you hear that, Madam Lucy? Can you help us verify the authenticity of this knot?

Madam Lucy?

Is the signal dropping?

Madam Lucy, can you hear us?

...

I'm sure she will be happy with what you've accomplished, 37.

Are you joining them, Ms. Marta?

...

It's our duty to do so.

...! Are you saying ...

So now you're choosing to be wise and look on.

But I don't understand. How could one be wise by being uninvolved and looking on from the sidelines?

Zeno's sent a ship to pick us up.

Let's go, 37. The researchers of Laplace would love to meet you.

Are you nervous? Afraid of the unknown world?

Have you got something for me, Mesmer?

The 162 curses aren't all of them, right?

Yes. I still remember what 37 said at the time.

She would rather name it after the mathematical properties of the knot, even if it's too much of a mouthful.

It's okay.

This is the one thing we need the most.

Don't you think one is not enough for my needs?

I think five, no, 15 might be more helpful.

My suitcase can't protect humans from the "Storm." They'll need the umbrella to survive.

In the future missions, I may encounter lots of—

Thank you, Mesmer.

37 was right.

It is a beautiful shape indeed.

Yes, it went smoothly. I was expecting something more complicated. So to get the umbrella, you only need to fill out forms.

Oh.

Lilya. How was your commendation ceremony?

I'm glad to see you back on your feet, Ms. Druvis.

In fact, there's a place I'd like to introduce you to, a flourishing island that survived both war and the "Storm." I think a talented druid like you would be of great help to them.

Funny you say that, Sonetto.

Now we have two new ships.

Heard about?

Hmm ... this is super awkward.

I don't see how these are correlated.

Didn't you worry that I might throw it away?

Thank you for your approval.

Was it normal rain?

Sonetto?

Sonetto, easy. You are going to break your wand.

Funny story, Mr. Horropedia. As an urban myth, however, the ending is way too clear and powerful. The element of drama ruins its authenticity.

You're good at making stories. Next time you can be more meticulous ... Hmm?

Anything wrong with the original destination?

No way. The place you are heading is ...

I am kind of attracted, indeed.

I know that case. I just never thought Mr. Campbell lost his because of this.

None of my classmates or instructors ever doubted the authenticity of such a curse when they gossiped of such things.

We're good. Don't worry. Cover your mouth and nose. Get out of the car.

Careful!

From the traces of activity here, it's probably been left by its indiscreet owner.

Wait. Is this the "Green Lake Campsite"?

We just met a madman who called himself an oracle. He drove people away from the land of demons.

Open it. If this is from a brutal crime, there might be some evidence inside.

You're back, Ms. Tooth Fairy. What did you find when you explored the campsite?

Horropedia, do you have some cobweb bullets to trap it?

According to the map, there is the other campsite built in a wider region. We can fight it there!

Turn left here, keep going for a hundred meters, and then cross the bush!

Shoot that bullet! It's going to get you!

The bush is right over there. Follow me. Let's speed up!

Protect the victims. Get ready to fight!

Vertin.

Film?

Good. Now it's time!

Nah, there's no way to follow it. The trees it pushed down have blocked the path. This would take us some time.

That was definitely not your usual critter. Ms. Tooth Fairy, what kind of traces did you find earlier?

Of course.

You are all students from Vines State College?

Blonney, is Anne also recruited as an actress? She is not as restless ... energetic as your classmates.

What on purpose?

We need to go outside to find him.

We are not in the human society. Aside from the "butcher," he might confront some other troubles.

Sonetto, you stay here with Ms. Tooth Fairy. I will go find Jason with Horropedia.

No matter if we find him or not, we'll come back in five minutes.

Then it means we are not in the kind of horror movie where misfortune only happens to "lone wolves."

If we don't come back, please evacuate the whole campsite and contact rescue.

I remember the weather broadcast said there won't be any rain in this area today.

Like the story of Zeno Youth Force, we are in real danger now.

Please calm down. We've only been trying to help.

We can't let them leave like this. Hurry up.

Over here. I found her!

Ms. Tooth Fairy and Horropedia, please follow them! Sonetto and I will handle this!

You are safe. The critter is gone. Don't worry.

Follow me. Take a deep breath. Hold my hand. Another deep breath.

Do you feel better now?

We didn't find her in the woods. Wasn't she in Michael's car?

It's okay. Here, take my hand.

We know where she is now, this is good. We will get her back safe and sound.

Is it yours, Blonney?

Anything special?

She is in great danger. We must act swiftly to save her.

Also, we need to turn this cabin into a security base for the upcoming battles.

Horropedia and I will rescue Anne. He is a horror movie expert, and it will be of great help.

In the meantime, you and Sonetto stay here to take care of Blonney and to secure this room.

So, what do you mean ...

Very comforting.

Wait. The carcass of the giant critter is missing.

It was dead. I've checked, and there was no way it could survive.

Here in the mud, it's the fur ... Oh also, what's this?

Let's follow up.

This smell, I think I've smelled this before.

The key, this is the smell of the key.

The moss here is definitely special. We need to take some samples back for Ms. Tooth Fairy.

It's Anne's voice. She must be here. Anne, can you hear me?

Below?

I see you.

Stay strong and take my hands. I will pull you out.

We saved Blonney but didn't find any of the boys. Don't worry. We will do our utmost to find them.

Anne!

That is ...

You can let go of me, Anne. It's over. He disappeared.

Yeah, you defeated him, like a marvelous miracle.

Good, they've set traps in front of the cabin. Sonetto!

Ms. Tooth Fairy, please take a look at this.

There's a special area near the woods where the temperature and humidity levels are higher, so mosses are ubiquitous.

I'm not sure. This place has been deserted for so long. We haven't found any trace of human activities.

So the moss not only affects humans, it also works on arcanists.

What about us? Why haven't we been affected?

Actually, I heard them all as well.

Watch out! Something is approaching.

Someone is passing messages to us through these notes.

If we defeat more monsters, we will get a clearer picture of what's happened at Green Lake Campsite.

Not to wait for the monsters, but "summon" them to us.

Horropedia, how likely is it for you to get their weaknesses right?

Good, this should be the last note.

Thank you for your update.

Sure, please.

Me?

Hmm. I think, I currently don't have any wishes.

My life is good enough without them.

You look pretty shocked. Have they all told you what they want?

Yeah?

Once we get out of here, their wishes will soon come true.

How about you, Anne? What do you wish to get?

I get it. Let's go back.

Noticed what?

We'll have to open it, according to the note.

We have dealt with more curses in the past two hours than many people do in their entire life.

If it is a curse, then it is a curse prepared for us.

The lighthouse is sinking. Everyone, move and leave now!

If I say I could stay?

Jessica, if I stay, what will you get me? Except for food and shelter, what else will you get me?

Sounds great. We will definitely have great fun.

But Jessica, where are the people who once chose to stay here?

When they stayed for long enough, after you ran out of all available games, they were no longer attractive to you and no longer adored by you.

I can stay longer than them, but with no exception, I will become boring one day.

You will be alone again. Every day, waking up, falling asleep, roaming in the dream alone …

You can lead a different life. You can embrace a diversified and meaningful life.

When you were Anne, you asked what my wishes were.

Now I know the answer. I know what I want.

It's you.

Do you want to come with me?

I will find you a good place to stay, where nobody will consider you to be weird, nor will they keep staring at you.

You will see the world with us—the amazing and unique outside world.

There are a lot of people and fantastic things out there.

There, some people eat gold bars; some others dance on the crocodile skin.

Some people ride a rocket, dashing into the sky, and eventually fall into an unknown Zero-G.

Even the grassland and the anonymous music in your dream, they truly exist ... in the outside world.

If you are willing to come with me, you will have them all.

Of course.

I promise, with everything I can offer.

What's this?

I see.

There are no enemies here. Everyone here is a member of our squad!

Please don't attack. Repeat, please don't attack!

People from the "outside world." Don't worry. They won't hurt you.

You might receive some training for a period. It might be a bit boring, but I promise it won't last too long.

...!

No problem, Ms. Tooth Fairy. I took the map with me before we got out. But there is smoke coming out of your car. Is it alright?

...

I'm fine.

So is the kangaroo.

I'm sure Medicine Pocket will bring us the Concentration Potion soon.

I didn't know you were famous.

Wait, calm down!

You are not in danger. She is.

Spathodea is suffering confusion. It's probably the flame's doing.

We need to separate them first.

No, you didn't. She's behaving exactly the way you described.

Looks like this is how she has her mental break.

We are running out of time. Let's deal with the burning issue first.

Spathodea!

We have to stop him.

…

Oliver Fog?

...

That we hoped you would aid our cause two days from now. With the enemy well hidden within the fog;  determining their location will be no easy feat. It looks like we'll be counting on you and your arcane skill to succeed.

It is indeed.

Mr. Knight will not be taking part in this operation, but he recommended you wholeheartedly.

.....Perhaps. But why would you suspect him in the first place?

...

So then, this your latest experiment in reformist rhetoric?

Look— I won't try to force you, Oliver. I'm merely here to discuss the matter with you.

...

I knew this was going to happen.

...No, it's best if we let the two of them sort this out on their own. I believe Mr. Knight will find a way to figure this out.

Is that so? Well... the thing is, the matter has been resolved.

To be precise, on the evening of our conversation, you and Mr. Knight appear to have worked together to resolve the issue.

Yes. we received word about a horde of critters in that forest known to attack humans.

Therefore, I had hoped that today, during the daytime, you could absorb the fog to help us locate that particular critter horde.

Since you and Mr. Knight already handled the critter situation, there is no need for you to remain at work today.

Correct. He told me he wished to spend the day paying tribute to his fallen brothers-in-arms... Men who chose to make the ultimate sacrifice in order to give hope to others.

And what motivated you to make this decision?

No, Oliver, there's nothing wrong with it. Perhaps it's only that your plan is so fitting for you that I'm at a loss for words.

Those critters would usually hide in the forest's fog during the day and only strike at night.

…

Erick, we need you to calm down.

No one could have anticipated this.

Sonetto...

We mean you no harm. Just, considering your father’s and grandfather's status as Arcanists, we would like to offer you as much help as possible.

But our school is unique. It's full of territories yet unclaimed.

We've already gotten Harald's consent, Erick.

This is what he left for you.

We promised him that we would ensure your safety at school.

He trusts you can handle this. I’m certain you will.

We can talk now.

Erick, this isn't what you promised us.

…

I don't think so.

What’s this?

I can't stop this.

You can’t stop her from growing up.

…

I promise.

I promise, what's happening outside is an anomaly that you can't yet understand. Everyone has been afflicted with a serious illness.

But we will eventually find a way to resolve this disaster.

Erick!

Mm-hmm.

Do we have a way to wake her up?

But aren't we supposed to be finding a way to wake her up?

Erick, I'm sorry. You know our agreement.

Due to this incident, you’ll be transferred to the School of Corrections until they determine you have sufficient self-control and common sense...

But first, I think...

You should know the truth about what's happening outside.

This is ...?

It's empty.

That's new to me.

... Mind the gap between your feet and the branches. Beware of those who slumber in the middle of the road.

Considering the age of some of the Zeno Youth Force, it's not really surprising.

You don't have to live that life anymore.

I'll cut out your hearts and eat your guts.

Fear me, you mortal! I am...

<size=38>I am the King of the Living Dead!</size>

That wasn't part of our rehearsal... But I think it means "Why aren't they scared?".

It all went smoothly, and ahead of schedule.

Everything all right on the home front?

Sorry. It was only a minor situation.

…

Looks as though you've different ideas for how to use them.

And to you, Ms. Druvis.

I'm very glad you came.

Is this ...

A Rowan Branch?

Thank you. I will take good care of it.

What are you doing out here all alone, Sonetto?

They did.

Regulus gave me a disc "for safe keeping."

Mr. APPLe apologized as he didn't possess any personal items to be given away, so he sang one of Regulus's favorite songs to make up for it.

Lilya gave me a leather care kit for my suitcase, and X gave me a metal ball which he assures me "will come in handy one day."

And of course, Sotheby and Ms. Druvis. Each gift was perfectly suited.

I feel the same.

Shall we go back inside? Regulus must have more prepared for us tonight.

Is this one of the Foundation's file cases?

Thank you, Sonetto. I like it very much, and I will put it to good use.

That is a high praise.

That pattern is called the Pythagoras tree.

I'm underage too.

What's in it?

Of course. Leave it to me.

Certainly, we can chat a little.

The name is Urd.

... I can't be sure. It's just a gut feeling.

The name is Urd.

... I can't be sure. It's just a gut feeling.

What?

What?

Twist ball?

There is no twist ball, Matilda.

Perhaps she forgot that she was supposed to hold the ball.

What about rainbow?

This is Vertin speaking.

Training?
