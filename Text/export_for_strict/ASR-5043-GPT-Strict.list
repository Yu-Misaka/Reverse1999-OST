/root/autodl-tmp/data/activityvoc_hero5043lvhu1_2_part02_27.wav|Vertin|en|I promise, with everything I can offer.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/activityvoc_hero5043lvhu1_2_part02_29.wav|Vertin|en|Now I know the answer. I know what I want.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_1.wav|Vertin|en|You're right. We've put too much time and effort into this plan to not carry it out now.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_10.wav|Vertin|en|Is this an illusion brought on by the fog? Or a new trial?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_11.wav|Vertin|en|No, something's not right. The arcane skill in that portal is fluctuating strangely.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_12.wav|Vertin|en|Everyone, it's almost time. Zeno will start any minute. We need to complete our preparations as planned and force Arkana to show up.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_15.wav|Vertin|en|She just showed up of her own volition.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_16.wav|Vertin|en|Copy that. This is a critical moment. Everyone stay alert and await my command.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_17.wav|Vertin|en|Great. Next, we destroy the portal.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_19.wav|Vertin|en|It's time to enact the final stage.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_2.wav|Vertin|en|The battlefield. It transformed.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_20.wav|Vertin|en|Looks like the way we came, but it's a little different.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_24.wav|Vertin|en|These signs, are they trying to take me somewhere?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_25.wav|Vertin|en|Critters eating beans and a white rooster. These are supposed to be taboos on the island.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_26.wav|Vertin|en|Arcana is dangerous. We may not be able to defeat her.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_27.wav|Vertin|en|No, things are going too well. Like this has been rehearsed.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_28.wav|Vertin|en|She's waiting for something.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_4.wav|Vertin|en|Is all this still an illusion?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_5.wav|Vertin|en|With 73. Because it has the largest absolute value.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_7.wav|Vertin|en|Is this creature changing its afflatus to match that of its attacker?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/hero5043_level_gudu1_9_8.wav|Vertin|en|No. Something's not right. The flow of arcane skills on the island has changed.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_30.wav|Vertin|en|I'm her friend. She left something.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_31.wav|Vertin|en|Misty bubble balls have an easily traceable scent. Sonetto will be here any minute.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_32.wav|Vertin|en|I see. Let's go, Sonetto.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_34.wav|Vertin|en|And this is...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_35.wav|Vertin|en|Sonetto, are you really going to continue the mission?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_37.wav|Vertin|en|Now everyone, get ready to break through.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_38.wav|Vertin|en|Regulus, I need you to brave the storm with me.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_39.wav|Vertin|en|Have you found out where Regulus usually spends her time? Or anyone who knows her?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_4.wav|Vertin|en|I need your help, so until you can give it to me, I'll help you out.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_40.wav|Vertin|en|Sonetto, your assistance please.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_43.wav|Vertin|en|I'll do my best to help before the storm arrives.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_44.wav|Vertin|en|It's a misty bubble ball. You know how to use it, right?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_45.wav|Vertin|en|Do you like the world outside, Sonetto?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_46.wav|Vertin|en|Exactly. Isn't this the bookstore?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_5.wav|Vertin|en|Regulus, you're doing this too.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_6.wav|Vertin|en|You know I'm not like you, Sonetto. You've trained your whole life to battle with arcanum. I ... took a different path ...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_7.wav|Vertin|en|Indeed, we have 45 minutes.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_8.wav|Vertin|en|The breach is behind us. The alley towards King's Road.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part01_9.wav|Vertin|en|Fifteen minutes left. Come on, let's move.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_10.wav|Vertin|en|Follow me, all the way down to the end of the path and into the depths.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_11.wav|Vertin|en|Our time is going backwards, Regulus.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_13.wav|Vertin|en|There's also something I need to find out for myself.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_14.wav|Vertin|en|the FIFA World Player of the Year, who then became a mass idol.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_15.wav|Vertin|en|Before meeting you, I had done so many experiments.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_16.wav|Vertin|en|I realised that you could see what I see in this world. So...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_18.wav|Vertin|en|I can't stand aside and watch you be taken away by Sonetto; have you disappear like the others in the "Storm."
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_2.wav|Vertin|en|At one point, I discovered that my suitcase was able to cut the storm out. It can preserve items from the last era too, like these photos.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_20.wav|Vertin|en|It was the beginning of the month. There couldn't have been a full moon that day. The real moon was to your west. There were two that night.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_21.wav|Vertin|en|A safe place. An ark. Sailing in the storm.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_24.wav|Vertin|en|Yes. I took this photo several days ago. He was selling Hoover upright vacuum cleaners in the West End and thought photos would help business, so he gladly posed for it.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_25.wav|Vertin|en|So I tried putting newspapers, mushrooms, even whopaloosies into the case. They all succeeded. However, when it came to the friends I'd made in the last era...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_26.wav|Vertin|en|They're stories from a long, long time to come.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_27.wav|Vertin|en|That is to say, I'm the one who records the beginnings and ends of eras.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_28.wav|Vertin|en|When you were out at sea, broadcasting on the radio, Regulus cried out, "Shout it to the full moon!"
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_3.wav|Vertin|en|These photos date forward to 1999. My time.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_30.wav|Vertin|en|I met her at a snack bar at 2am. Her one-act play about the Transantarctic expedition was a real masterpiece.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_31.wav|Vertin|en|You've braved the storm. My experiment succeeded. Thank you for your help.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_32.wav|Vertin|en|Hold my hand. Let me take you into the suitcase.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_33.wav|Vertin|en|Not good. Seems our suitcase has been found.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_34.wav|Vertin|en|It's alright. It's just... the end of an era.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_35.wav|Vertin|en|By critters, maybe. Or just someone passing by. Sorry. I need to leave for a while. Need to hide it somewhere safe.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_36.wav|Vertin|en|Relax, Regulus. I will tell you, but not here.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_38.wav|Vertin|en|I'm the timekeeper. I keep track of time in the outside world.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_4.wav|Vertin|en|Maybe I should just record the time, be a silent, emotionless observer. Act as the Foundation has asked me to.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_42.wav|Vertin|en|I'm from the St. Pavlov Foundation, the same place as the investigators you just met. We actually grew up there together.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_47.wav|Vertin|en|Please, allow me to reintroduce myself.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_49.wav|Vertin|en|No one can follow us here. We can speak freely.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_5.wav|Vertin|en|At the countdown to the millennium, before the clock struck twelve, time reversed. We were sent back to the explosion of the supernova in the eighties, to the release of VHS.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_6.wav|Vertin|en|and to the 1960s, where I met you.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_7.wav|Vertin|en|This is Julie, who once invited me to her house. Her bedroom wall was covered with posters of Rivaldo.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_8.wav|Vertin|en|This is Marion Smith, a single mother. She worried if she could afford to feed her child every night, but she never gave up her dream of being a writer.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_1.wav|Vertin|en|I... I seem to see my mother.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_10.wav|Vertin|en|Those unconscious Arcanists behind you are the original victims, right?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_11.wav|Vertin|en|We don't have much time. Let's hurry up to the hidden position. Mr. Apple, why are you a little upset?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_14.wav|Vertin|en|The Foundation is currently the charity that can provide the best treatment for arcanists. There is no doubt about it.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_15.wav|Vertin|en|Mr Apple, how long will it take for the suitcase to be completely invisible?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_16.wav|Vertin|en|I was also one of them. Since I can remember, I know it very well that I am alone.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_17.wav|Vertin|en|Sonetto?! Why are ... Is it because I touched ... that line?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_19.wav|Vertin|en|The forces of the Manus expand dramatically year by year. To stop the trend, we do need additional manpower.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_2.wav|Vertin|en|Every few years, the Foundation selects talented Arcanists from children around the world.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_20.wav|Vertin|en|Maybe that's my mistake. If there is no question, we are ready to go.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_21.wav|Vertin|en|I have no intention to make enemies of the Foundation. As I said, I just want to find out the truth. All the truth about 1999.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_22.wav|Vertin|en|As for Dr Pepper, I think Sonetto will find a way.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_23.wav|Vertin|en|Thank you for bringing the message, Sonetto.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_25.wav|Vertin|en|So, you have seen what the storm was like?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_26.wav|Vertin|en|Then come back as soon as you finish the registration. The foundation is open to the public, but it's still heavily guarded.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_27.wav|Vertin|en|This is my suitcase. Please give it back to me.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_28.wav|Vertin|en|It will probably take some time for them to wake up. Hide them under the car first.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_29.wav|Vertin|en|Mr Apple, I need your help.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_30.wav|Vertin|en|So, what's the first mission for our team?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_32.wav|Vertin|en|We should go. I will carry it with me along the way.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_36.wav|Vertin|en|Why did you all black out?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_37.wav|Vertin|en|You are awake. How do you feel? Any discomfort?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_38.wav|Vertin|en|The subculture movement has indeed changed the social status of some arcanists. While in the 1920s ... there are still many injustices.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_4.wav|Vertin|en|All of us. Our memories of 1999 are blurred. I can only remember that she was placed on a laboratory bed, surrounded by many medical staff.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_41.wav|Vertin|en|They shouted her name, and mine, and I can't remember anything else. Later, no matter how hard I tried to ask, the official answer I got was always no such person.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_42.wav|Vertin|en|There's still 30 minutes. Who's coming early?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_44.wav|Vertin|en|I can't see her at all. The fog is getting thicker.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_46.wav|Vertin|en|Difference in talent is never and never will be the reason to deprive people of life.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_47.wav|Vertin|en|Until 1999, when the first storm came.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_49.wav|Vertin|en|But... Sonetto, did you have oranges just now? There is a scent of orange on the capsule...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_5.wav|Vertin|en|If they shake the suitcase like this, Regulus will probably fall apart.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_50.wav|Vertin|en|They go to orphanages and admonition centers, and even fish out unique ones from the prisons in detention centers.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_51.wav|Vertin|en|Let me explain. Regulus, Apple, what I invited you to join before is... The St. Pavlov Foundation.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_55.wav|Vertin|en|I... I seem to have seen this. It's... I...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_56.wav|Vertin|en|What happened? I don't seem to be affected.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_57.wav|Vertin|en|Hide it in the tree hole this time. It shouldn't be that easy to be found.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_58.wav|Vertin|en|I know what you said to Sonetto just now is expedient. I can still help you get out of here.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_61.wav|Vertin|en|No one's here. The light is off. Did she go to another room?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_65.wav|Vertin|en|The line is... Two-dimensional?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_8.wav|Vertin|en|Regulus! Why are you there?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_1.wav|Vertin|en|There's an address on the seal—Polypotion Bar, The Walden.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_10.wav|Vertin|en|As long as one of us can leave the woods, there is hope for the rest.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_19.wav|Vertin|en|The exit on the northwest ... It's quite close to The Walden on the map.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_21.wav|Vertin|en|Oh. So it is said that in the early 20th century, there was a devastating forest fire in Washington.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_22.wav|Vertin|en|The Walden. It may have the answer to all the questions.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_24.wav|Vertin|en|Thank you very much for your help, Miss Druvis.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_25.wav|Vertin|en|They follow the travellers without making any sounds. And in order to see everyone's face clearly, they will...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_26.wav|Vertin|en|Sonetto, update the result to the headquarters.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_27.wav|Vertin|en|I request access to the historical intelligence on the US financial market in 1929, specifically the date of the Wall Street stock market crash and how much Arcanum was involved in the methods of stock exchange.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_3.wav|Vertin|en|Stock? Why does it always have something to do with financial securities?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_32.wav|Vertin|en|Also, I request sending backup to reinforce the Storm Gathering tonight. Casual wear required.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_35.wav|Vertin|en|Lots of unknown creatures. Sonetto, stay behind me!
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_5.wav|Vertin|en|Speaking of which, Sonetto, have you ever heard of a ghost story about "fire"?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_7.wav|Vertin|en|No, too many of them. We can only take one round at most, not for long.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_8.wav|Vertin|en|Those who died unfortunately didn't want to leave, and they turned into dark ghosts in the woods.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_att_9.wav|Vertin|en|Mr Apple, how much longer can you hold on?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_1.wav|Vertin|en|You've been there. The scent of orange in Sonetto's mission capsule. That's why you can hijack the hostages outside the parking.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_11.wav|Vertin|en|They've made an underground labyrinth in the speakeasy. The end of the labyrinth. What will that be?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_13.wav|Vertin|en|I'm going. Don't worry.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_14.wav|Vertin|en|Go. Run freely.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_15.wav|Vertin|en|Got it. Let's head down to The Walden now. You follow APPLe. Remember, to stay low profile.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_16.wav|Vertin|en|The market is really dropping ahead of time. To accelerate the history like this, is that for...
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_21.wav|Vertin|en|Did you find out the relationship between Manus Vindictae and him?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_23.wav|Vertin|en|There will be many unexpected dangers in the labyrinth. We need to move carefully.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_28.wav|Vertin|en|The hidden path they just made. That may work.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_29.wav|Vertin|en|Community conflicts, turbulent history, new technology, all of these may lead to the storm.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_30.wav|Vertin|en|They've reconstructed the building. All the exits are blocked.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_31.wav|Vertin|en|I just don't feel good about this. Hopefully it's my misjudgment. Is everyone in position?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_32.wav|Vertin|en|What if I say, I can provide you with a shelter?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_36.wav|Vertin|en|Is Schneider casting an arcane skill?

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_40.wav|Vertin|en|Why did you go to the Foundation? Can't the Manus give you what you want?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_41.wav|Vertin|en|Leave four behind for the team! Everyone else move! Don't get caught!
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_42.wav|Vertin|en|We can't keep fighting like this. We need to find a way out.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part02_8.wav|Vertin|en|Correct. I finally got the answer.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter2_part01_10.wav|Vertin|en|Why? I've decided to join you.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter2_part01_12.wav|Vertin|en|I... I think I just saw a critter. Didn't watch my step when driving it away.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter2_part01_14.wav|Vertin|en|Ah, thank you for wiping the mud off my face.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter2_part01_16.wav|Vertin|en|The three questions are all done. It's already... already enough!

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter2_part01_20.wav|Vertin|en|You often see strange creatures? Are you also an arcanist?

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part02_6.wav|Vertin|en|The arcane skills cast by the congregation on this island are very different from those we have seen.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part02_63.wav|Vertin|en|I'll explain to you later. Trust me. Please, Sonetto.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part02_66.wav|Vertin|en|I'll ask something else instead. What is this place?
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part02_68.wav|Vertin|en|There's no fluctuation of arcane power either. I can't even sense the slightest signs.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_5.wav|Vertin|en|It is easy to prove Sonetto's innocence.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_50.wav|Vertin|en|I see. So that's how it works.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_56.wav|Vertin|en|I need to tell you something more important.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_58.wav|Vertin|en|Relax. I will help you.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_61.wav|Vertin|en|In that case, it's not possible for Sonetto to commit a crime in the Hall of Truth. Because she can't even be in the Hall.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_69.wav|Vertin|en|Why do you keep referring to the storm as the emanation?

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter4_part01_17.wav|Vertin|en|The wind feels so good.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter4_part01_20.wav|Vertin|en|The unexpected first storm brought more than half of the Foundation's elite members away from us. The number of staff of the House of Integratus and the Committee cannot compare with that of their heyday. Even now.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter4_part01_29.wav|Vertin|en|The storm has been here for eight years. None of the people who are left behind can shake off the influence it brought.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter4_part01_34.wav|Vertin|en|Beyond their control, these new Arcanists only brought fear. They demand an unchallengeable power to make decisions, and a harsher control of Arcanists.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_48.wav|Vertin|en|I heard that you completed all the lessons on the scripture.

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_52.wav|Vertin|en|Yes. She put it on without hesitation.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_53.wav|Vertin|en|What's Manus Vindictae's purpose to be here?

/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part04_21.wav|Vertin|en|The cave is the key to be immune to the storm.
/root/autodl-tmp/data/plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part04_36.wav|Vertin|en|I'm telling the truth, 37. I've been there, in the storm of 1929.
