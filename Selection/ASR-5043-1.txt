.\training_set\activityvoc_hero5043lvhu1_2_part02_12.wav|Vertin|en|We'll have to open it, according to the note.

.\training_set\activityvoc_hero5043lvhu1_2_part02_19.wav|Vertin|en|There's a special area near the woods, where the temperature and humidity levels are higher, so mosses are ubiquitous.

.\training_set\activityvoc_hero5043lvhu1_2_part02_27.wav|Vertin|en|I promise, with everything I can offer.
.\training_set\activityvoc_hero5043lvhu1_2_part02_29.wav|Vertin|en|Now I know the answer. I know what I want.

.\training_set\activityvoc_hero5043lvhu1_2_part02_7.wav|Vertin|en|If it is a curse, then it is a curse prepared for us.

.\training_set\hero5043_level_gudu1_9_1.wav|Vertin|en|You're right. We've put too much time and effort into this plan to not carry it out now.
.\training_set\hero5043_level_gudu1_9_10.wav|Vertin|en|Is this an illusion brought on by the fog? Or a new trial?
.\training_set\hero5043_level_gudu1_9_11.wav|Vertin|en|No, something's not right. The arcane skill in that portal is fluctuating strangely.
.\training_set\hero5043_level_gudu1_9_12.wav|Vertin|en|Everyone, it's almost time. Zeno will start any minute. We need to complete our preparations as planned and force Arkana to show up.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_2.wav|Vertin|en|At one point, I discovered that my suitcase was able to cut the storm out. It can preserve items from the last era too, like these photos.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter0_part02_20.wav|Vertin|en|It was the beginning of the month. There couldn't have been a full moon that day. The real moon was to your west. There were two that night.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_10.wav|Vertin|en|Oh right, guess what I found today?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_12.wav|Vertin|en|The dripping water has made the ground uneven. For these tiny worms, these descending areas are like impassable gulfs.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_13.wav|Vertin|en|But now, they've become tools for punishing naughty kids.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_14.wav|Vertin|en|May I ask, how much further do we have to go?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_15.wav|Vertin|en|Seems that they are not orientated by sounds. What matters to them is the grain.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_16.wav|Vertin|en|The instructor did teach two incantations to repel insects, but Shamirs are not any ordinary worm. They were in fact a kind of advanced critter. The elementary arcane skills won't work on them.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_18.wav|Vertin|en|Hmm, these things sticking to my shoe are... O-brands.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_19.wav|Vertin|en|Look, the foreteller of the rain, the Hyaluraboria.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_2.wav|Vertin|en|It's said that the Shemirs are marvellous creatures. Even King Solomon searched for them for years.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_24.wav|Vertin|en|Manus Vindictate always has more information on the storm and how to be immune to it. We've been trying our best to keep up with their progress.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_26.wav|Vertin|en|You're not planning on destroying this place now, are you Regulus?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_29.wav|Vertin|en|There might be some clues that are invisible.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_23.wav|Vertin|en|Wait a second, Regulus.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_28.wav|Vertin|en|I have a question for you, Zanetto.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_20.wav|Vertin|en|Until the day we lose life itself.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_23.wav|Vertin|en|Weird. Why no shimeh seh?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_25.wav|Vertin|en|Is my book haul still there? She didn't push it down, right?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_13.wav|Vertin|en|How do you feel now? I'm sorry about what happened in the rehab centre.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_15.wav|Vertin|en|This interrogation won't get us anywhere.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_33.wav|Vertin|en|They won't know.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_35.wav|Vertin|en|I should come back and check again later.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_10.wav|Vertin|en|It has my name on it.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_26.wav|Vertin|en|Oh, so that's the case.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_16.wav|Vertin|en|Thank you, Sonato.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_27.wav|Vertin|en|I have everything I need. Grains to lure them and wools to drive them away.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_17.wav|Vertin|en|As to Regulus' question,
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_28.wav|Vertin|en|Hmm... This is...
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_18.wav|Vertin|en|The current will be flowing backwards every time the Earth is at a felion and perihelion. This is also known as the current reversal.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_3.wav|Vertin|en|The pebbles, the frogs, the attic with stinky socks. They're just a teeny tiny part of the whole world. I once met a girl who came to our school.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_30.wav|Vertin|en|Um... They can't do anything to this ball blanket.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_31.wav|Vertin|en|Why? Just because the student handbook says so?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_32.wav|Vertin|en|It keeps croaking in my pocket. Look, it's still raining outside.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_34.wav|Vertin|en|Well, to me as well.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_24.wav|Vertin|en|Haa.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_36.wav|Vertin|en|Oh right, I'll check what this padlock is made of and see if it can be consumed by the schmears.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_37.wav|Vertin|en|I don't like the handbook. It smells like those stinky socks in the attic.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_38.wav|Vertin|en|Is this their food?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_4.wav|Vertin|en|Here is a thin layer of mud on the ground. Judging from its volume, it's not likely to be brought in by other children who were once here for confinement.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_7.wav|Vertin|en|I can apply for a ship for you, but it's not guaranteed.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_40.wav|Vertin|en|which means the wall of this room should be made of...
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_41.wav|Vertin|en|There are at least a few hundred Shemitah, and they're all moving towards me.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_42.wav|Vertin|en|I'm sorry. I just wanted to see you clearly, since your speech was so wonderful.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_52.wav|Vertin|en|You were bringing them back to Manus Vindictae?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_46.wav|Vertin|en|You were also in that parade outside the school before.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_48.wav|Vertin|en|Water keeps dripping down from the side of the ceiling near the window. But it hasn't room for days.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_50.wav|Vertin|en|Alright, let's move. Expel them to the corner.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_60.wav|Vertin|en|I see. I have only one question.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_40.wav|Vertin|en|What?!
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_51.wav|Vertin|en|Ouch! Please don't bite me two times in a row.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_61.wav|Vertin|en|I see.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_52.wav|Vertin|en|Let alone there are no signs of my arcane abilities up till now. Maybe... I'm not an arcanist at all.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_53.wav|Vertin|en|But I can't stay here forever. There are food in every corner. He will get here sooner or later.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_62.wav|Vertin|en|With these files and the help of Regulus, that should be enough.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_63.wav|Vertin|en|As far as I know, no one is called by that name but me.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_43.wav|Vertin|en|I was not sure.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_54.wav|Vertin|en|Oh, it hurts.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_55.wav|Vertin|en|and so you can leave without a backward glance
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_64.wav|Vertin|en|Fortunately, now we have another direction.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_65.wav|Vertin|en|Well, she did try her best to pick the music.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter1_part01_45.wav|Vertin|en|Huh.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_56.wav|Vertin|en|Could the ground be left like this so as to slow down the worms and give us the time to cast incantations?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_60.wav|Vertin|en|I've jumped over here. The Shamirs just keep crawling towards the grains.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_63.wav|Vertin|en|The legend says that the way to store Shamir worms is to wrap them in wool and store them in a container made of lead.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_64.wav|Vertin|en|Time to try a brand new dish, you old gentleman.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_65.wav|Vertin|en|Finally, get them all to the corner.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_66.wav|Vertin|en|I caught it through the school's front gate. I even got stung by the electric fence when I took my hands back.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_69.wav|Vertin|en|But why would they gather around my feet?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_53.wav|Vertin|en|though no one is in the mood. I think this piece is not bad.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_54.wav|Vertin|en|Yes, I understand what you mean. But for now, the evidence can't support our speculation.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_55.wav|Vertin|en|2. 1913
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_56.wav|Vertin|en|I'll be careful. Thank you, Mesma.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_66.wav|Vertin|en|Luckily, Miss Morzon noticed the signs of it at the beginning.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_50.wav|Vertin|en|Okay.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_59.wav|Vertin|en|Then I have no further questions.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part01_71.wav|Vertin|en|Turns out their route has been planned already.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part01_41.wav|Vertin|en|The Apollo star we just heard about means the sun. The Ford Sextant Model T is an arcane device produced in the early 19th century. The Scientific Computing Centre has one of those as a part of their collection.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_12.wav|Vertin|en|Amazing. Everything's going so well today. You keep watching. We'll be right there.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_13.wav|Vertin|en|I found the technical drawings of the air defence renovation in the library, and added the missing underground tunnel part to the map.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_29.wav|Vertin|en|We have prepared for everything that could happen. No regrets.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_30.wav|Vertin|en|Everything goes so well today. Too well, maybe. Making me uneasy.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_31.wav|Vertin|en|Okay, now split up. Once the central watchtabber slices out, we move. I will see you under the A12 window of the library.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_33.wav|Vertin|en|Look, this is the full map of our school, including the aerial view of the schools and the blocks nearby.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_44.wav|Vertin|en|That's all. Be careful, I will see you soon.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_45.wav|Vertin|en|Years after, when I think of that escape.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_48.wav|Vertin|en|I have very important things to say to you. I've now obtained the map of the school, including the blocks around it, but now we can't meet in public places, as there are students watching us. George the Oak was also zoned to the alert area.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_49.wav|Vertin|en|Ha! Ha!
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_5.wav|Vertin|en|Go back. Get yourself out of these things.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_51.wav|Vertin|en|But we won't sing it anymore. I think other students are still locked in the guardhouse.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_56.wav|Vertin|en|It's alright, Ring. What we're going to do this time is much more dangerous than last time, and we may lose everything we have.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_57.wav|Vertin|en|The most dangerous part is from the dorm to the library. Not only will we pass the classroom, but also be exposed under surveillance of the central watchtower.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_58.wav|Vertin|en|Exactly. Once we get down to the tunnel, we will be much safer. Have you left the window open at the first floor?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_59.wav|Vertin|en|I'm fine. It doesn't hurt so much now. It hurt more than the tear gas burned me.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_60.wav|Vertin|en|Don't let Daniel guard. Let me see.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_61.wav|Vertin|en|Back then, I knew nothing about chess, nor resigning, let alone the fact I was in the Zugswang.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_64.wav|Vertin|en|It's impossible to go to the clinic through the girls' dorm. The clinic is now crowded with people and we must give up the road to the South East Watchtower.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_68.wav|Vertin|en|The number of Alitio has recently increased, airdropping packages with various stuff.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_69.wav|Vertin|en|You guys retreat immediately and I'll cover for you. As long as one of us can get out of school, our plan succeeds.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_7.wav|Vertin|en|We have another option, to go to the classroom first, then enter the airy tunnel from the library.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter3_part03_71.wav|Vertin|en|According to the map, we are now out of the library. Keep going, everyone!

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_17.wav|Vertin|en|But the detecting device showed nothing. If we were to find out more, we have to go to the center area.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_18.wav|Vertin|en|That was not your fault, Sonetto. It is now behind us.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_19.wav|Vertin|en|A wooden box in the Illity House base has my name on it.
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_2.wav|Vertin|en|Shoot, if I could have one more chance.

.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_28.wav|Vertin|en|Wait, these are the records before 2003, you say?
.\training_set\plotvoc_hero5043chapter5_part03_29.wav|Vertin|en|Haven't you been to a school, Regulus?
